* Python Set Investigations
  These are some tools to help experiment with the behavior of Python's =set=
  type. It's behavior in the face of hash collisions is... weird. Consider the
  following:

#+begin_src python
[{i, i + 8} for i in range(6)] #=> [{8, 0}, {9, 1}, {10, 2}, {3, 11}, {4, 12}, {13, 5}]
#+end_src

  That's wacky.
